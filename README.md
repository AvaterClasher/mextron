The `docs` folder is the input directory of the project and is always specified while running dev server or building. You can specify a different input directory like this:

-   The `theme` folder contains all site templates and styles. It is written using [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) syntax.
-   The `global.css` file contains the global CSS of the website, you can write your own CSS in this file.
