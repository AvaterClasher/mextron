# Slice-Helper

The SliceHelper is a versatile Handlebars helper designed to extract a portion (slice) of an array or object based on specified start and end indices.

Parameters:

- Array: The array or object from which to extract the slice.
- Start: The starting index of the slice.
- End: The ending index of the slice.

Usage Example:

```rust
{{#slice data.array 1 4}}
  <!-- Content to be displayed for each item in the slice -->
{{/slice}}
```

## Description

The SliceHelper is a powerful tool for working with arrays and objects in Handlebars templates. It intelligently handles both types, providing a seamless way to extract a subset of elements. Here's how it works:

### Array Slicing

If the provided array is an array (JSON array), the helper extracts a subarray containing elements from the start index to the end index (inclusive).
Each element in the subarray is made available within the block, allowing you to render content for each item.
Object Slicing:

If the provided array is an object (JSON object), the helper extracts a new object containing key-value pairs from the start index to the end index (inclusive).
The block is executed for each key-value pair in the sliced object, providing flexibility in rendering content.
Error Handling:

The helper performs robust error checking to ensure that the necessary parameters are provided and that the indices are valid.
If any errors occur during the process, such as the absence of the array or incorrect indices, the helper returns a RenderError with an appropriate message.

### Example Usage

Consider having a JSON array data.array:

```rust
{
  "array": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
}
```

You can use the SliceHelper to extract a subset of this array in your Handlebars template:

```rust
{{#slice data.array 1 4}}
  <!-- Content to be displayed for each item in the slice -->
{{/slice}}
```

This example would output:

```rust
20
30
40
```

### Conclusion

The SliceHelper simplifies the process of working with array and object slices in Handlebars templates, offering a clean and efficient solution for scenarios where you need to display or manipulate specific subsets of data. Incorporate this helper into your projects to enhance the flexibility of your templates.
